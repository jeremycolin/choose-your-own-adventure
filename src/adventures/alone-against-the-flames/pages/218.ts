You are grateful to relinquish the load.\n\t“Nobody here has anything like a car.” She strokes her chin and narrows her eyes. “Maybe you could find somebody with a horse and a cart for your bags. I could ask around later. Try Mr. Winters at the village hall, he'll know if anyone will. Or ask among the artisans. Their workshops are first left on Silbury Street.” She reaches over and squeezes your wrist. “Don't worry, I won't see you sleeping in the street, money or no money.”\n\tYou thank May, and turn to face the village.",
