  text: "You realize Silas hasn't made a stop since the incident with the tractor. The motor coach winds its way uphill.

In the distance the White Mountains rise into hazy cloud. There is no settlement, not even a cabin, as far as the eye can see. Birds drift through the treetops, and you can just make out what might be two white-tailed deer lingering by the water.\n\tPerhaps you are making a mistake by moving to the city. Could you survive on your own in this lush wilderness?",
