She'll have been listening to us. Ruth! Come and greet our guest.”\n\tThere is a short pause, then the door creaks open. Two wide eyes peer at you from the gap, between tousled hair and a rough nightgown.\n\t“What do you say?\n\t”The eyes blink. “Pleased to meet you.”\n\t“Now get back to bed.”\n\tThe door closes again.\n\t“My daughter Ruth. Ten years this summer. She's a delight and a torment all in one. Don't worry, she sleeps in with me. She'll not disturb you. Good night now.”  You retire to your room. It is a little chilly, but you are too tired to worry about lighting the fire. The sheets are clean and the bed soon warms up. The silence outside is strange after living in a town for so long.",
